# Movie Recommendation System
Are you a lover of 20th century movies?
If yes, then this tool is for you.
This tool will recommend movies on the basis of genre, director, actors etc. Autoencoders is the technique used here, it will learn correlations by recreating ratings of every customer. Then it will improve its predictions by backpropagating the errors.
#### I have written an article on recommendation system using autoencoders [here](https://medium.com/@s.ganjoo96/autoencoders-with-pytorch-a89ed28f94a9)
